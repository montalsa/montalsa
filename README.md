Hello! I'm **@montalsa**. I lead operations and programs for the **Office of the CEO** at [@GitHub](https://www.github.com). Past lives include Technical Program Management, Engineering and Product Operations, and Chief-of-Staff work at [Slack](https://www.slack.com), [Plaid](https://www.plaid.com), and [Flite](https://www.snap.com) (acquired by Snap). I grew up in Georgia 🍑, went to college in Nashville 👨‍🎤, and am now based in San Francisco 🤖.  I enjoy reading, tinkering, and outdoor stolls.
