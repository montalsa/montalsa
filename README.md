Currently leading operations and strategic programs in the **Office of the CEO at [GitHub](https://github.com)**, where I drive cross-company execution across GitHub and Microsoft

### What I do

I specialize in the messy, high-stakes work that sits between strategy and execution: standing up systems that turn ambiguity into momentum during the moments that matter most — leadership transitions, hypergrowth, platform shifts, and major launches. I design the operating rhythms, coordination architecture, and decision frameworks that keep complex orgs shipping.

### Where I've done it

- **GitHub** — Office of the CEO · Cross-company strategy, special project transformation programs
- **Plaid** — Engineering and Product operations during expansion and scaling
- **Slack** — Program management and engineering operations during hypergrowth
- **Flite** *(acquired by Snap)* — Early-stage product and engineering operations

### How I think about the work

I believe great operations is invisible when it's working — and obvious when it's not. The best operators don't just run playbooks; they build the playbooks, know when to throw them out, and create the conditions for the people around them to do their best work. I'm drawn to inflection points: the moments where a company is becoming something new and needs someone to build the bridge between where it is and where it's going.

### Beyond work

Originally from Georgia 🍑, college in Nashville 🎸, based in San Francisco 🌁 (for now). I'm a reader, a gamer, a horror movie enthusiast, and I believe the best ideas come from getting out of the building.
